# Porch Performance Testing Setup Guide

## Prerequisites
- Docker
- Kubernetes CLI (kubectl)
- Go development environment
- Access to GitHub repositories

## 1. Set Up Development Environment
Run the following script to set up the development environment:
```bash
https://github.com/nephio-project/porch/blob/main/scripts/setup-dev-env.sh
```

## 2. Build and Deploy Porch
Execute the command below to build and deploy Porch in a Kubernetes Kind cluster:
```bash
make run-in-kind
```
Once deployment is complete, you should see the related pods running.

## 3. Create a Demo Namespace
Create a namespace for the demo setup:
```bash
kubectl create namespace porch-demo
```

## 4. Define Gitea Repositories in Porch
Apply the repository configuration file:
```bash
kubectl apply -f examples/tutorials/starting-with-porch/porch-repositories.yaml
```

Note: The Gitea credentials secret is automatically created when running the tests. The configuration can be found in `gitea-secret.yaml`.

## 5. Verify Repository Setup
Check the status of repositories in the porch-demo namespace:
```bash
kubectl get repositories -n porch-demo
```

## 6. Run Performance Tests
Navigate to the performance test directory:
```bash
cd test/performance/
```

Execute the performance test command:
```bash
E2E=1 go test -v ./... -repos=4 -packages=4 -timeout 60m
```

Parameters:
- `repos`: Number of repositories to test
- `packages`: Number of package revisions in each repository

Once the tests begin, the logs can be observed in logs dir a sample is shared below.

```

## 7. Verify Prometheus Targets
Check the Prometheus targets:
```
http://localhost:9090/targets
```
You should be able to run PromQL queries here.

## 8. Check Metrics Output
Retrieve the captured metrics using:
```bash
curl -k http://localhost:2113/metrics
```
This should return all the collected performance metrics from the test execution.

## Prometheus Setup

The performance testing framework uses a Kubernetes-based Prometheus setup. The configuration is stored in `prometheus-manifests.yaml` and includes:

- ConfigMap with Prometheus configuration
- Deployment for the Prometheus pod
- Service to expose Prometheus

The Prometheus instance is automatically deployed in the `porch-demo` namespace when running the tests. You can access the Prometheus UI at:
```
http://localhost:9090
```

The configuration can be modified by editing `prometheus-manifests.yaml`. Key settings include:
- Scrape interval: 1s
- Resource limits: 512Mi memory, 200m CPU
- NodePort: 30090
