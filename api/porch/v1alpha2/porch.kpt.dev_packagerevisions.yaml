                  The task slice holds zero or more tasks that describe the operations
                  performed on the packagerevision. The are essentially a replayable history
                  of the packagerevision,

                  Packagerevisions that were not created in Porch may have an
                  empty task list.

                  Packagerevisions created and managed through Porch will always
                  have either an Init, Edit, or a Clone task as the first entry in their
                  task list. This represent packagerevisions created from scratch, based
                  a copy of a different revision in the same package, or a packagerevision
                  cloned from another package.
                  Each change to the packagerevision will result in a correspondig
                  task being added to the list of tasks. It will describe the operation
                  performed and will have a corresponding entry (commit or layer) in git
                  or oci.
                  The task slice describes the history of the packagerevision, so it
                  is an append only list (We might introduce some kind of compaction in the
                  future to keep the number of tasks at a reasonable number).

                        This should be when the underlying condition changed.  If that is not known, then using the time when the API field changed is acceptable.
