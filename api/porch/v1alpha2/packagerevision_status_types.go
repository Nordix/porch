// This file contains types used in PackageRevision status fields.
// These types are intentionally duplicated from the kpt library to maintain API independence.

// The following types (Locator, OriginType, and GitLock) are intentionally duplicated from the kpt library
// to maintain API independence and avoid external dependencies in the API package.

// OriginType defines the type of origin for a package
type OriginType string

// Locator is a resolved locator for the last fetch of the package
type Locator struct {
	// Type is the type of origin.
	Type OriginType `json:"type,omitempty"`

	// Git is the resolved locator for a package on Git.
	Git *GitLock `json:"git,omitempty"`
}

// GitLock is the resolved locator for a package on Git
type GitLock struct {
	// Repo is the git repository that was fetched.
	// e.g. 'https://github.com/kubernetes/examples.git'
	Repo string `json:"repo,omitempty"`

	// Directory is the sub directory of the git repository that was fetched.
	// e.g. 'staging/cockroachdb'
	Directory string `json:"directory,omitempty"`

	// Ref can be a Git branch, tag, or a commit SHA-1 that was fetched.
	// e.g. 'master'
	Ref string `json:"ref,omitempty"`

	// Commit is the SHA-1 for the last fetch of the package.
	// This is set by kpt for bookkeeping purposes.
	Commit string `json:"commit,omitempty"`
}
